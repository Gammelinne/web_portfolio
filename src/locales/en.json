        "Website": "https://github.com/Gammelinne/Lahyra-back-V2",
        "Description": "Lahyra is my most significant personal project. It was built using VueJS (JavaScript) for the frontend and Laravel for the backend (PHP). This project encompasses a wide range of advanced features that make it robust and secure. - First and foremost, let's delve into the JWT (JSON Web Token) protected authentication. JWT is a highly popular authentication mechanism utilized in modern web applications. The primary advantage of JWT is its ability to maintain authentication state on the client side, eliminating the need for the server to store authentication state for each user. Instead, when a user successfully logs in, they receive a JWT token containing encoded credential information. This token is then included in every subsequent request sent to the server, enabling the server to authenticate and authorize the user for each request. - Moving on to language management with I18n, Lahyra has the capability to support multiple languages. This is a crucial feature for applications targeting an international audience as it allows users to select their preferred language. With this functionality, texts and messages displayed to the user can be easily and dynamically translated, providing a more personalized experience. - Another important feature of Lahyra is the ability to upload and store photos. Users can upload images to the site, which are then securely stored on a server or an appropriate storage service. This feature offers a convenient solution for users who want to share photos or images as part of their Lahyra experience. - Additionally, Lahyra integrates WebSocket with Pusher. WebSocket is a bidirectional communication protocol that enables real-time communication between the client and the server. By leveraging WebSocket in Lahyra, instant and real-time updates can be achieved without the need to refresh the page. This results in a more responsive user experience, especially for features that require real-time updates, such as notifications or live conversations. - Furthermore, by clicking on 'API Routes', users can access a comprehensive list of all the routes functioning on the site. Some of these routes are protected by administrator privileges, meaning they can only be accessed by users with administrative rights. This security measure ensures that certain sensitive or restricted features can only be utilized by authorized users, thereby enhancing the overall security of the application.",

        "Title": "Portfolio",
        "Date": "June 2023",
        "Website": "https://github.com/Gammelinne/web_portfolio",
        "Description": "My portfolio is a personal project created using VueJS (JavaScript) with Vuetify. VueJS is a popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces, and Vuetify is a UI component library that provides ready-to-use components following the Material Design guidelines. Together, VueJS and Vuetify offer a powerful combination for developing visually appealing and interactive web applications. - To enhance the functionality of the portfolio, various libraries have been incorporated. One of them is I18n, which stands for Internationalization. I18n allows for easy translation and localization of the portfolio into multiple languages. This feature is crucial for reaching a broader audience and providing a personalized experience to users who prefer different languages. - For handling HTTP requests, the portfolio utilizes Axios, a widely used JavaScript library. Axios simplifies the process of making asynchronous HTTP requests, such as retrieving data from APIs or sending data to a server. It provides an intuitive and efficient way to interact with backend services, enabling seamless data exchange between the frontend and backend of the portfolio. - To ensure smooth navigation within the portfolio, Vue Router is employed. Vue Router is the official routing library for VueJS. It enables the creation of dynamic, single-page applications with multiple views or pages. By utilizing Vue Router, the portfolio can have separate routes for different sections, allowing users to navigate between different pages without the need for full page reloads. - In addition to the functional aspects, the portfolio also features a dark mode system. Dark mode provides an alternative color scheme that uses darker colors, which can be easier on the eyes, reduce eye strain, and conserve device battery life. To provide a seamless experience for users, the selected mode (dark or light) is stored in the local storage of the user's browser. This means that even if the user refreshes the page or closes the browser, the portfolio remembers their preferred mode and applies it consistently."
